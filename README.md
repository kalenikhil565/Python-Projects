# ✋ Hand Gesture Detection 🚀  

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Detection** project! This Python application leverages **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect and display hand landmarks and connections in real-time. It's perfect for building gesture-based systems, exploring computer vision, or experimenting with human-computer interaction.

## 🌟 Features  
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Detects **21 landmarks** on each hand frame-by-frame.  
- **Gesture Visualization**: Connects detected landmarks to visualize hand gestures effectively.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Enables gesture-based interaction with visual feedback.  
- **Customizable**: Extend the functionality for your own gesture-controlled applications!

# Python-Projects

Running the Hand Gesture Detection Project:

Install Required Libraries:

Before running the project, make sure you have installed the necessary libraries. You can install them using pip:
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
Download and Save the Code:

Copy the Python code you provided and save it to a Python file, e.g., hand_gesture_detection.py.
Run the Python Script:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved hand_gesture_detection.py.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python hand_gesture_detection.py
Using the Application:

Once the script is running, your computer's camera will activate.
Show your hand in front of the camera, and the program will detect and display hand landmarks and connections on the screen.
You can test different hand gestures and observe the program's response.
Exit the Application:

To exit the application, press the 'Esc' key (usually represented as '27' in the terminal).
README.md File (for your project documentation):

Create a README.md file in the same directory as your Python script (hand_gesture_detection.py) and include the following information:

# Hand Gesture Detection

This Python project detects and displays hand landmarks and connections using the MediaPipe library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- Mediapipe (mediapipe)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe

markdown
Copy code

## Running the Application

1. Download the code (`hand_gesture_detection.py`) from this repository.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `hand_gesture_detection.py` is saved.
4. Run the script using the following command:

python hand_gesture_detection.py

python
Copy code

5. Your computer's camera will activate, and the program will detect and display hand landmarks and connections.
6. Experiment with different hand gestures in front of the camera to observe the program's response.
7. To exit the application, press the 'Esc' key.

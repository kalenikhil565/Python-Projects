# Hand Gesture Detection 🚀

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Detection** project! This Python application utilizes the powerful **MediaPipe** library to detect and display hand landmarks and connections in real-time. Whether you're building a gesture-based control system, experimenting with machine learning, or simply exploring hand gesture recognition, this project has you covered!


## 🛠️ Requirements

Before you run the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (opencv-python)
- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)

To install the required libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
🚀 Running the Application
Download the Code:
Clone or download the code from this repository and save it as hand_gesture_detection.py.

Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt:
Navigate to the directory where you saved hand_gesture_detection.py.

Run the Script:
To start the hand gesture detection application, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python hand_gesture_detection.py
Use the Application:
Once the script is running, your computer’s camera will activate. The application will detect your hand and display key landmarks and connections on the screen in real time.

Experiment with Gestures:
Try different hand gestures and watch the program respond! Each gesture is detected by the program and visualized on the screen.

Exit the Application:
To exit, simply press the 'Esc' key (ASCII value 27) on your keyboard.

✨ Features
Real-time Hand Tracking:
Detects 21 hand landmarks on each frame captured by the camera.

Gesture Visualization:
Connects the detected landmarks with lines to help visualize your hand gestures.

Interactive Interface:
Use your hand gestures as an input method to interact with the application.

🔧 Project Overview
This project leverages MediaPipe's hand tracking model, which allows for accurate and fast hand gesture recognition. It can be used for building gesture-controlled systems, human-computer interaction applications, and even virtual reality (VR) applications.
